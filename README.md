# VirtualPiano
Just a simple playable virtual piano.

I love to play the piano in my free time. That is why I thought it would be fun to develop a web page which
is just that. A piano.
This is a project to first get introduced to front-end development. I used CSS to design the piano properly
and JavaScript to work with the input from the keyboard.
